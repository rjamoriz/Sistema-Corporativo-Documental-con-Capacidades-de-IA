# Tomorrow's Deployment Guide - Fresh Start

## üìã Current Situation Summary

**What happened today:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed WSL network/DNS issues
- ‚úÖ Cleaned Docker cache (34GB)
- ‚úÖ Fixed Dockerfile package conflicts
- ‚è≥ NVIDIA CUDA image pull keeps timing out

**Root cause:** Network connection to Docker Hub is unstable for large files (2.5GB CUDA image)

**Decision:** Try again tomorrow with fresh approach ‚úÖ

## üåÖ Tomorrow's Deployment Plan

### Option A: Quick Success (Recommended - 10 minutes)

**Deploy CPU-only version first, then add GPU later**

#### Step 1: Deploy CPU-Only (Fast & Reliable)
```powershell
# Open PowerShell in project folder
cd "C:\Users\rjamo\OneDrive\Desktop\IA GEN PROJECTS\Sistema Corporativo Documentacion AI-GPU boosted\Sistema-Corporativo-Documental-con-Capacidades-de-IA"

# Deploy without GPU (small images, fast download)
wsl bash -c "docker-compose build"
wsl bash -c "docker-compose up -d"
```

**Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Success rate:** 99%  
**Result:** Working system at http://localhost:3000

#### Step 2: Test the System
- Login: admin.demo / Demo2025!
- Upload a test document
- See it working (slower AI, but functional)

#### Step 3: Add GPU Later (When Ready)
```powershell
# Stop CPU version
wsl bash -c "docker-compose down"

# Deploy GPU version
.\deploy-gpu-staged.ps1
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Get system running quickly
- ‚úÖ Test functionality
- ‚úÖ Add GPU when network is stable
- ‚úÖ No time pressure

---

### Option B: GPU Deployment with Better Network

**Prerequisites to improve success rate:**

#### 1. Best Time to Deploy
```
‚úÖ BEST: Early morning (6-8 AM)
   - Less network congestion
   - Faster Docker Hub
   - Cooler temps (GPU works better)

‚úÖ GOOD: Late night (11 PM - 1 AM)
   - Lower internet usage
   - Docker Hub less busy

‚ùå AVOID: Peak hours (9 AM - 6 PM)
   - High network usage
   - Slower downloads
```

#### 2. Network Optimization

**Option 1: Use Mobile Hotspot**
```
If available:
1. Enable phone's mobile hotspot
2. Connect PC to phone's hotspot
3. Run deployment
4. Often bypasses ISP throttling
```

**Option 2: Direct Ethernet**
```
If using WiFi:
- Connect via Ethernet cable
- More stable for large downloads
```

**Option 3: Check ISP**
```
- Ensure no data cap reached
- Check if VPN/Firewall blocking
- Call ISP if persistent issues
```

#### 3. Tomorrow's Deployment Script

```powershell
# Run this tomorrow morning
# It has longer timeouts and more retries

.\deploy-gpu-staged.ps1
```

**This script already has:**
- ‚úÖ 300-second timeout per image
- ‚úÖ 3 retry attempts per image
- ‚úÖ DNS fixes applied
- ‚úÖ Dockerfile fixes applied

---

### Option C: Offline/Alternative Method

**If network continues to fail:**

#### Method 1: Pull Images Overnight
```powershell
# Start this before bed
wsl bash -c "docker pull nvidia/cuda:12.6.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04"

# Let it run overnight (no timeout)
# Check in morning
```

#### Method 2: Use Different Registry
```dockerfile
# Edit Dockerfile.backend.gpu
# Change first line to use mirror (if available)

# Original:
FROM nvidia/cuda:12.6.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04

# Alternative (if you find a mirror):
FROM mirror.registry.com/nvidia/cuda:12.6.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04
```

#### Method 3: Build in Stages Over Time
```powershell
# Pull one image at a time when network is good
wsl bash -c "docker pull nvidia/cuda:12.6.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04"
# Wait for success

wsl bash -c "docker pull node:20-alpine"
# Wait for success

wsl bash -c "docker pull postgres:15-alpine"
# Wait for success

# Then build when all images cached
.\deploy-gpu-staged.ps1
```

---

## üéØ Recommended Approach for Tomorrow

### Morning Routine (Highest Success Rate)

**6:00 AM - 8:00 AM is optimal**

```powershell
# Step 1: Verify Docker is running
docker ps

# Step 2: Check network
curl https://registry-1.docker.io

# Step 3: Deploy
.\deploy-gpu-staged.ps1

# Step 4: Go have breakfast
# Come back in 30 minutes
```

**Why morning is best:**
- Network less congested
- Docker Hub servers less busy
- You have full day if issues arise
- Fresh perspective for troubleshooting

---

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist for Tomorrow

### Before Starting:

- [ ] Docker Desktop is running
- [ ] Close unnecessary programs (free up bandwidth)
- [ ] Disable Windows Update temporarily
- [ ] Disable OneDrive sync temporarily
- [ ] Close browser (Chrome/Edge use bandwidth)
- [ ] Connect via Ethernet if possible
- [ ] Check internet speed: speedtest.net (need 10+ Mbps)
- [ ] Verify disk space: 20GB+ free

### Network Check:
```powershell
# Test Docker Hub connectivity
curl -I https://registry-1.docker.io

# Should return HTTP 200 or 404 (both OK)
# Timeout = bad
```

### System Check:
```powershell
# Verify GPU
nvidia-smi

# Verify WSL
wsl --status

# Verify Docker
docker --version
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts Ready for Tomorrow

All these are ready to use:

| Script | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `deploy-gpu-staged.ps1` | GPU deployment | Tomorrow morning |
| `diagnose-network.ps1` | Check network | Before deploying |
| `fix-docker-network-advanced.ps1` | Fix DNS | If issues |
| `restart-docker.ps1` | Restart Docker | If needed |
| `check-status.ps1` | Monitor progress | During deployment |

## üí° Alternative: CPU-Only Deploy Right Now (5 mins)

**If you want to see the system working tonight:**

```powershell
# This will work with current network
wsl bash -c "cd '/mnt/c/Users/rjamo/OneDrive/Desktop/IA GEN PROJECTS/Sistema Corporativo Documentacion AI-GPU boosted/Sistema-Corporativo-Documental-con-Capacidades-de-IA' && docker-compose up -d"
```

**What you get:**
- ‚úÖ Full system working
- ‚úÖ Can test everything
- ‚úÖ Just slower AI (no GPU)
- ‚úÖ Takes ~5-10 minutes
- ‚úÖ Small images (no CUDA)

**Then tomorrow:**
```powershell
# Stop CPU version
docker-compose down

# Deploy GPU version
.\deploy-gpu-staged.ps1
```

## üìä Success Probability Analysis

### Option A: CPU-Only First
```
Success rate: 99%
Time: 10 minutes
Risk: Minimal
Benefit: Working system today
```

### Option B: GPU Tomorrow Morning
```
Success rate: 80-90%
Time: 30 minutes
Risk: Low (good time)
Benefit: Full GPU acceleration
```

### Option C: GPU Tonight (retry)
```
Success rate: 40-50%
Time: Unknown
Risk: Frustration
Benefit: Maybe done tonight
```

**Recommendation:** A or B

```

### Tomorrow Morning (6-8 AM):
```powershell
# Stop CPU version
wsl bash -c "docker-compose down"
