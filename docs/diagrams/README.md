# Diagrams Sources

This folder contains source models for architecture diagrams.

- PlantUML C4: `c4-context.puml`, `c4-container.puml`
- Structurizr DSL: `workspace.dsl`
- Mermaid diagrams: `*.mmd` (if present)

CI will generate static SVGs into `docs/generated-diagrams/` using Kroki/Mermaid CLI.

Links in the root README point to those SVGs as fallbacks.
